## Overview

The Smart Task Scheduler Bot is a **personal reminder system for Discord** that delivers DM-based reminders with **concurrent timers**, with python programming, asynchronous task scheduling, error handling, and message formatting using **embeds**.

---

## Features

- **DM Reminders**: Users receive private reminders via Discord direct messages.   
- **Task Management**: Each reminder has a unique task ID; users can list pending tasks and cancel them.  
- **Human-Friendly Timing**: Supports time inputs like `10s`, `5m`, `1h`, and shows live countdowns.  
- **Multi-User and Multi-Task Support**: Background worker handles multiple reminders concurrently using `asyncio.Queue`, and also handles tasks for multiple users simultaneously without conflicts.  
- **Error Handling**: Accounts for invalid input, missing permissions, and DM restrictions.

## Technical Highlights

**Concurrent Task Handling**:  
- Multiple reminders from different users can be scheduled without blocking each other.  
- DM sending, countdown tracking, and command processing all run asynchronously.  
- The bot uses `asyncio.Queue` to schedule tasks concurrently.  
- A background worker dequeues tasks and waits asynchronously for the execution time.  

**Modular & Reusable Design**:  
- `scheduler.py` handles all task logic and timing.  
- `commands.py` handles Discord commands and task registration.  
- `embeds.py` generates all rich message embeds.  
- This separation makes the code easier to maintain, test, and extend.

## Future Extensions

- **Priority Levels**: High/medium/low priority reminders with dynamic execution order.  
- **Recurring Tasks**: Automatically repeat reminders on a schedule.  
- **Persistent Storage**: Store tasks in a database or file to survive bot restarts.  
- **Enhanced Embeds**: Include progress bars, timestamps, or reaction buttons for interactive reminders.
